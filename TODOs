Ask about GlobalPlatform Pro versions
     - track them in the analysis and among the cards?

Results analysis

Ownership of code
    - put all licences together and go though them

TODO: Add test build for JDK 7 and 8
TODO: jc310 does not work for baload-bastore
    and most probably all other

Give a table of compilation warnings
Verification results etc.

How to work out additional jc versions
Make it work with JDK 1.7
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/apache/tools/ant/launch/Launcher : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0
    ant_javacard support target and source version

Add ant target to build build dir
and make other depend on it

put RID, PIX, AID into config (package etc variants)

TODO: How to write log messages

TODO: Add to source code files
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

TODO: add mypy
TODO: maybe some of the processes create java log files in ~
TODO: flake8 specific configuration is not defined within the project, see ~/.config/.flake8

IDEAS
- add ago to start and end analysis times
- show communication nicely
- allow hiding unnecessary output of stages
- scrolling output stages
- Better explanation for the legend

Test if the applet AID has to be a0000000000062 or not. - javacard package

TODO!!!
